# landing-page
Simple static landing page to direct to subdomains

This is a bare bones bootstrap-styled landing page with a notice at the top letting users know they can click cards to visit subdomains.

## What is this for?
If you have various subdomains that host content but you don't have anything going on at the top domain, you can host this page to show users _something_ if they poke around
